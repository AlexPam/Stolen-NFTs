## About the Project ###

Phishing attack has been a major problem for web 3 NFTs platforms. Attackers target smart contract most often to carry out maliciuos activities. Top NFTs platforms like NBA Top Shots, OpenSea, Rarible and Binance have no fault in this attacks because it all balls down to the end user detecting the genuinity of the transaction before signing any contract.

## Dataset

For this project I created a query for the NFT Tokens dataset. This dataset contains information about various datasets regarding NFTs across the internet. 

### Built With
- Dune analytics

Dune Analytics is a data platform that crypto-asset analysts and investors use to research specific projects such as NFTs, DeFi platforms, or blockchain ecosystems. Anyone can query the data and create visualizations using Dune.

- POSTGRE SQL  
This is one of the several free popular databases, and it is frequently used for web databases.

## Data Collection 
Firstly, the aim of the visualization is to make visual analysis of stolen NFTs on OpenSea. To this effect, dataset of NFTs Token was collected from Dune analytic database to begin the visualiztion.

# Project 2: Address of Maliciuos attackers #

## About the project ##

This project focuses on address of malisiuos addresses. Usually this are addresses linked to indivdual apks or websites which end up luring users to think they are genuine and hence committing their data to such sites.

## Dataset

For this project I created a query for the NFT Tokens dataset. This dataset contains information about various datasets regarding NFTs across the internet. 

### Built With
- Dune analytics

Dune Analytics is a data platform that crypto-asset analysts and investors use to research specific projects such as NFTs, DeFi platforms, or blockchain ecosystems. Anyone can query the data and create visualizations using Dune.

## Data Collection 
Firstly, the aim of the visualization is to make visual analysis of attackers address to the commuinity. The dataset was queried from Dune anlytics database.
